# CSNP — Core Security Network Platform

CSNP (Core Security Network Platform) is an enterprise platform engineering and distributed architecture laboratory focused on building governance-driven Internal Developer Platforms (IDP), Zero Trust security architectures, and cloud-native distributed runtime systems.

This repository provides an executive architecture overview of the CSNP platform, including platform capabilities, developer experience workflows, security models, and key architecture decisions.

---

## 🎯 Platform Vision

CSNP explores how modern enterprise platforms can balance governance, developer autonomy, and system reliability while enabling scalable distributed application development.

The platform focuses on:

- Governance-first platform engineering
- Internal Developer Platform (IDP) enablement
- Zero Trust security architecture
- GitOps-driven operational control
- Domain-driven fintech and distributed system modeling
- Cloud-native runtime platform design
- Developer onboarding and service standardization

---

## 🧠 Core Design Principles

CSNP is built around several fundamental architectural principles:

- Governance enables safe developer autonomy
- Identity and trust boundaries define system reliability
- Domain integrity must be preserved across distributed workflows
- Infrastructure and platform automation reduce operational risk
- Enterprise platforms must evolve predictably over time
