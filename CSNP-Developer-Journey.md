# CSNP — Developer Platform Journey

## Overview

CSNP provides a standardized developer experience that enables engineering teams to safely build and operate distributed services through automated platform guardrails and governance workflows.

---

## Service Onboarding

Developers begin by creating a new service using standardized templates that enforce architectural patterns and platform integration requirements.

Platform onboarding ensures:

* Compliance with deployment standards
* Integration with identity and secrets management
* Observability and logging readiness

---

## Build and Continuous Integration

Services are automatically validated through CI pipelines that enforce quality, security, and artifact governance.

Key steps:

* Code validation and testing
* Container image build and scanning
* Artifact publishing and version tracking

---

## Deployment and Environment Promotion

Deployment follows GitOps-based promotion workflows across environments.

Promotion stages typically include:

* Development
* Integration / Staging
* Production

Each promotion stage enforces governance policies and deployment validation.

---

## Runtime Operations

After deployment, services are managed through platform observability and reliability tooling.

Capabilities include:

* Health monitoring
* Distributed tracing
* Logging and metrics analysis
* Incident detection and response support

---

## Continuous Improvement

Platform governance and developer experience evolve continuously through feedback, automation refinement, and service onboarding improvements.
